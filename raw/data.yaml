Roll Mechanics
  Player action - Dice Pool
  - pick a stat (or roll 2 dice)
  - get dice equal to the stat
  - add dice from equipment, abilities, advances, and injuries
  - ROLL
  - discard 1,2,3s
  - 4,5 success +1 damage, defense or blood
  - 6 critical success +2 damage, defense, blood or activate a SPECIAL
  - allocate dice: (As you allocate each dice, add one detail that describes the scene as it happens. If those details satisfy new bonus dice conditions on the equipment or abilities you’re using, you can roll those bonus dice at this stage.)
    - advance an objective: reduce the Objective’s rating by 1, critical by 2
    - eliminate a threat: reduce the Threat’s rating by 1, critical by 2
    - defend against an attack: remove one of the GM’s Attack dice, critical remove two
    - feed on a nazi +blood: gain 1 Blood, critical 2 Blood
    - activate a SPECIAL: Only usable when a critical is rolled

  GM action - Threat Pool
  - get dice equal to the Threat Attack Rating
  - ROLL
  - discard 1,2,3s
  - 4,5,6 success +1 damage
  - After Player allocation of Dice: if the GM has Attack dice remaining, you roll [1d6] for a category and mark an Injury. If the GM has three or more Attack dice remaining, you instead mark all Injuries in that category and are Downed 

  Flashbacks (when 2 success the button shows on the chat)
    Roll on the flashback tables to define a question, or choose one that appeals
    When your flashback is over, add 2 dice to your pool, then roll all of your dice again. The second result stands.
