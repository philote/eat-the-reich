### An Unofficial EAT THE REICH System for Foundry VTT
EAT THE REICH is a chaotic, ultraviolent tabletop RPG where players take on the roles of vampiric commandos on a bloody mission to tear through Nazi-occupied France during World War II. Written by [Grant Howitt](https://bsky.app/profile/gshowitt.bsky.social) and illustrated by [Will Kirkby](https://bsky.app/profile/chamonkee.bsky.social), and published by [Rowan, Rook and Decard](https://rowanrookanddecard.com). The game blends pulpy action, dark humor, and horror as players use their supernatural abilities to slaughter Nazis and consume their blood. With fast-paced mechanics and a rebellious tone, EAT THE REICH delivers an over-the-top, cathartic power fantasy drenched in gore and irreverence.
